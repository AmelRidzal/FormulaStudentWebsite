And lo, Saint Clarkson appeared before us, robed in torque and holiness, bearing the Sacred Engine forged in the fiery depths of the Nürburgring.

His gaze was steady, his compression ratio divine.
And he spake unto the congregation:

“Rev not with doubt in your carburetor, but believe in the might of displacement.”

And so the faithful knelt — grease-stained and full of horsepower — whispering prayers of performance:

“Deliver us from misfires, O Lord of the Piston Ring.
Protect and save our engines, Amen.”

Let not thy oil be synthetic falsehood. Let not thy turbo lag test thy patience.
For He who holds the V8 close to His chest shall never stall on the highway of life.

May your fuel always be premium,
your gears always synchro,
and your check engine light — eternally off.

Amen, and vroom.
